# Card Kings
## COP4331 - Spring 2017

Card Kings is a Unity 3D application that features a realistic casino where you can play against 5 other AI players

The user can play Texas Hold 'em or Pineapple (a slight variation on Texas Hold 'em where the player discards a third card at the start of the game)

Voice commands are parsed with Google's Speech API, easily integrated with a Unity Asset purchased from the store.

The in-game instructions inform you of everything necessary to play.
